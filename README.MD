# RGB PWM LEDSTRIP CONTROLLER

Finally found a use for the [Digispark](http://digistump.com/wiki/digispark). It now serves as a RGB LED controller. Three potentiometers are used to set the value for each channel. The Digispark reads the potentiometers, who are set up as voltage dividers. It then translates these readings to PWM values and powers the LEDS through three NPN Mosfets.
